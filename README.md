## 🧭 Project Overview

As a Marketing Analytics Engineer at **AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS)**, your task is to analyze historical insurance claim data from February 2014 to August 2015. This analysis will help ACIS optimize marketing strategies and identify low-risk customer segments for competitive pricing.

In this task, we:

- ✅ Set up a Git repository with proper documentation (`README`, `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Implemented Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions
- ✅ Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, quality, and patterns in the dataset
- ✅ Visualized key insights such as loss ratios, trends over time, geographic differences, and vehicle risk profiles
